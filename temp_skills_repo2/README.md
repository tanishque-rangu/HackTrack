# AAS Core — Agentic Awesome Skills

> **Find reusable instructions for your project, inspect their complete files, and keep an exact skill set you can review and reuse.**

Agentic Awesome Skills is a library of 2,476+ installable `SKILL.md` playbooks. AAS Core helps Codex or Claude search the complete local catalog, record the skills the agent chooses, and preview a plan you can inspect before changing a target. Core does not rank or recommend skills.

**Current release: V18.8.0.** AAS Core supports local catalog inspection, agent-owned selection, stack validation, and plan preview. Apply and recovery remain experimental. [Read the AAS Core preview guide](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/v18.8.0/docs/users/aas-core.md) for setup and exact trust boundaries.

This README tracks `main`. Features listed under [Unreleased](CHANGELOG.md#unreleased) require a later release; the versioned guide describes the published package.

This is an independent community project, not affiliated with or endorsed by Google. Google, Antigravity, Gemini, and related names describe compatibility and install targets. The GitHub repository is canonical; the [hosted catalog](https://aaskills.tech/) and browser-local Workbench are companion discovery and review surfaces.

## AAS Core: Agent-First Preview

Codex or Claude inspects your project and chooses exact skills. Every current catalog skill is individually searchable, readable, and available for agent selection. The read-only `compose_stack` tool validates the chosen IDs and structure in memory; a client or the `aas` CLI can persist `aas-stack.json` and optional selection evidence. `aas stack validate` checks the manifest, while `aas stack plan` writes an immutable preview for your review. Manifests have a technical maximum of 128 skills; Core does not rank or recommend candidates or install skills in this supported preview path.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Structural and identity validity does not certify semantic fit, compatibility, setup correctness, operational safety, or safety to apply. Apply and recovery require experimental opt-in and remain outside the supported preview.

The [Workbench](https://aaskills.tech/workbench) reviews stack and plan artifacts in browser memory without accessing your filesystem. See the [Core guide](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/v18.8.0/docs/users/aas-core.md) for tool contracts, capability coverage, and limits.

## Installation

### From selection to use

Start with AAS Core in Codex or Claude. Configure the local MCP using the [Codex](docs/users/codex-cli-skills.md) or [Claude](docs/users/claude-code-skills.md) guide. With the MCP available, ask the agent to inspect your project, compare relevant skills, and save the exact selection. Then validate its manifest and review the resulting plan before any installation. The first configuration command previews a change and returns an approval digest:

```bash
npm exec --yes --ignore-scripts --package=agentic-awesome-skills@18.8.0 -- aas mcp configure \
  --host codex \
  --scope user \
  --config /absolute/path/to/codex/config.toml \
  --cache-root /absolute/path/to/aas-cache
```

Use `--host claude` and its configuration path for Claude. The [Core setup guide](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/v18.8.0/docs/users/aas-core.md#configure-the-local-mcp) explains approval, reconnection, validation, and planning. To hand the reviewed IDs to the direct installer, use `aas stack install-preview` as described in the [manifest handoff](docs/users/aas-core.md#use-the-reviewed-selection); that command only prepares a `--dry-run` preview and does not apply a Core plan.

### Install selected skills directly

If you already know the IDs, preview a focused install into your host's skill directory:

```bash
npm exec --yes --ignore-scripts --package=agentic-awesome-skills@18.8.0 -- \
  agentic-awesome-skills --release 18.8.0 --path .agents/skills \
  --skills brainstorming,systematic-debugging --dry-run
```

Review the preview, then repeat without `--dry-run` when ready. The direct installer does not consume or apply a Core plan. Antigravity's watched skill directory can overload its context, so its default target requires a selected set, a filter, or an explicit `--all` override. See the [installation guide](docs/users/getting-started.md) and [security guidance](docs/users/security-and-antivirus.md) for other targets, auditing, and failure modes.

## Choose Your Tool

Use the path for your agent. Core setup is available for Codex and Claude; the other rows show direct install targets or plugin options.

## Bundles & Workflows

Bundles suggest related skills; workflows describe the order to use them. They are guidance for selecting and running skills, not additional packages to install.

- [Bundles](docs/users/bundles.md) group skills by role or goal, such as `Web Wizard`, `Security Engineer`, and `OSS Maintainer`.
- [Workflows](docs/users/workflows.md) give ordered playbooks for planning, shipping, testing, and auditing; [workflow metadata](data/workflows.json) is available for integrations.
- If too many installed skills overload Antigravity, follow the [selective activation guide](docs/users/agent-overload-recovery.md). For other hosts, preview a smaller exact install or use the installer's `--risk`, `--category`, and `--tags` filters.

## Browse 2,476+ Skills

Explore the complete library in the [hosted catalog](https://aaskills.tech/) or [`CATALOG.md`](CATALOG.md). The canonical playbooks live in [`skills/`](skills/); [`skills_index.json`](skills_index.json) provides machine-readable discovery. Use [Getting Started](docs/users/getting-started.md) and [Usage](docs/users/usage.md) for first steps, or the [Workbench](https://aaskills.tech/workbench) to inspect a saved Core stack and plan in your browser.

For narrower comparisons, see [Claude Code skills](docs/users/best-claude-code-skills-github.md), [Cursor skills](docs/users/best-cursor-skills-github.md), and the [library comparison](docs/users/agentic-awesome-skills-vs-awesome-claude-skills.md).

## Stable Skills Manifest v1

Host integrations that load individual `SKILL.md` files can use [`skills_index.json`](skills_index.json), the [v1 schema](schemas/skills-index.v1.schema.json), and the [compatibility mirror](data/skills_index.json). This direct-host discovery manifest is separate from `aas-stack.json` and the AAS Core catalog. Read the [discovery contract](docs/users/discovery-manifest.md) before integrating.

## Contributing

- Add new skills under `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` and follow [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Start from the [skill template](docs/contributors/skill-template.md) and run `npm run validate` before a PR.
- Keep source PRs free of generated registry artifacts. Skill content and risky guidance require manual logic and safety review alongside automated checks.
